			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>The Mike Naff Memorial Scholarship was created by the Naff Family in association with Virginia Tech to provide assistance to an undergraduate student in the Pamplin College of Business seeking an information systems or information technology degree. Mike affectionately referred to all of his friends and colleagues (men and women) as "the guys" and the younger staff members as the "young guys." He always talked about how the "young guys" brought new energy and ideas to the group. The Naff Family hopes that this scholarship will allow many more "young guys" to enter the field. This tournament was established by Mike's family and friends to help fund the scholarship and to help others in his memory.</p>

			<p>The Mike Naff Memorial Golf Tournament is a 501(c)(3) organization.</p>
