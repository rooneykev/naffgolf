			<h1>Mike Naff</h1>
<p>
	Mike was born on May 24, 1956 in Roanoke, VA. He attended Cave Spring High School and then graduated from James Madison University. While at JMU he was a 4-year starting pitcher for the baseball team. Shortly after graduation, Mike began his 34-year career at Virginia Tech, where he served as the Director of Application Information Systems for 11 years. Throughout his career he provided information technology support and system solutions to most major administrative departments on campus.</p>
<p>
	Mike was an active member of both the Virginia Tech and New River Valley communities and was a big supporter of the Virginia Tech Hokies and JMU Dukes. A member of Blacksburg Country Club for over 20 years, Mike was very active on the golf committee, served on the board of directors and served as president of the board for one term. Mike greatly enjoyed a good golf game, but mostly loved the fellowship with his golf buddies. Mike was also an active member of Blacksburg United Methodist Church.</p>
<p>
	In March 2008, Mike was diagnosed with melanoma. He fought a long and courageous battle for almost four years with help from his family and friends. Ultimately, despite many treatments and his bravery, he lost that battle on February 10, 2012 at the age of 55. Mike never let cancer get in the way of spending time with those he loved, once commenting, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of dying, I&rsquo;m afraid of not living&rdquo;.</p>
<p>
	Mike was the quintessential family man and was married to his wife, Diane, for over 32 years. He was a proud father to Jessie, a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine who serves as a physician in the US Navy and Ryan, who is a cost accountant at the Virginia Bioinformatics Institute at Virginia Tech.</p>
